# The State of Data Science: Insights from Kaggle Report 2022

In 2022, Kaggle, the largest online community of data scientists conducted a survey to gather information about the state of data science and machine learning. Kaggle, as per its data democratization culture, made the raw data accessible to all its members in the platform. The raw dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022/data). 

In this project, I utilize the raw data from the kaggle report to derive key insights and identify trends in data science and machine learning. The analysis was conducted using MySQL and Pandas. The entire analysis process from data prepartion to visualization is documented in seven jupyter notebooks. Below is a list of the notebooks and the topics they cover in the analysis:

# Findings

## Respondents Demographics
1. Data science is heavily men-dominated. Over 70% of the respondents identify as men. Why aren't there more women in data science?
2. Half of the respondents identifty as students
3. Data was collected from over 57 countries. However, 49% of the respondents were either from India or the US
4. Data science is applicable to pretty much all industries. Over 14 industries were mentioned in the survey. Of these, three sectors, computer/technology, government/public service, and broadcasting/communication, employed over 46% of the respondents

## Becoming a Data Scientist
1. Data scientists need at least a bachelor's degree. Only 15% of the respondents have attained/wish to attain a level of education less than a bachelor's degree
2. Kaggle and Twitter are the most helpful media sources for data science news. This is according to over 70% of the respondents
3. The best learning platforms for data science are Datacamp and Coursera - over 70% of the respondents
4. Video platforms are most preffered by data science students - 60% of the respondents

## How Do Data Scientists Spend their Time
1. According to 36% of the respondents, most data scientists spend their time analyzing and understanding data to influence product or business decisions
2. The second core activity is building prototypes for applying machine learning to new areas

## Data Science Compensation Analysis
1. From a global perspective, the typical trend is that more coding experience results in higher pay. However, the US trend shows that more experienced personnel are still in the lower ranks in the compensation scale
2. In terms of compensation alone, data scientists in the US earn considerably higher annual salary in comparison to the global trend. While most data scientists in the US earn above USD 50,000 per year, a significant number in other parts of the world make less than that.
