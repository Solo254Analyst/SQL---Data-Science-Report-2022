# The State of Data Science: Insights from Kaggle Report 2022

In 2022, Kaggle, the largest online community of data scientists conducted a survey to gather information about the state of data science and machine learning. Kaggle, as per its data democratization culture, made the raw data accessible to all its members in the platform. The raw dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022/data). 

In this project, I utilize the raw data from the kaggle report to derive key insights and identify trends in data science and machine learning. The analysis was conducted using MySQL and Pandas. The entire analysis process from data prepartion to visualization is documented in seven jupyter notebooks. Below is a list of the notebooks and the topics they cover in the analysis:

1. Data Preparation - [Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/Solo254Analyst/SQL---Data-Science-Report-2022/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Report%202022%20-%20PART%201%20Data%20Preparation.ipynb)
2. Creating a Multi-Table Database Design - [Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/Solo254Analyst/SQL---Data-Science-Report-2022/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Report%202022%20-%20PART%202%20Creating%20A%20Multi-table%20Database%20Design.ipynb)

#Findings

##Respondents Demographics
1. Data science is heavily men-dominated. Over 70% of the respondents identify as men. Why aren't there more women in data science?
2. Half of the respondents identifty as students
3. Data was collected from over 57 countries. However, 49% of the respondents were either from India or the US
4. Data science is applicable to pretty much all industries. Over 14 industries were mentioned in the survey. Of these, three sectors, computer/technology, government/public service, and broadcasting/communication, employ over 46% of the respondents
